🌼 About Me

Hi! I’m Nur Jannah Sabri, a Business Analyst with hands-on experience in requirement analysis, system documentation, UAT execution, QA testing, and basic frontend development.

I enjoy transforming business ideas into functional systems, designing user flows, testing features, and ensuring users have the best possible experience.
